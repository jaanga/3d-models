[3D Models Read Me]( index.html )
===

It really helps designing, building and testing online 3D apps if you have access to lots of online 3D Models. 
This repository provides links to 3D models you ca use in your apps from a variety of sources.
Some models are hosted in this repository while others are hosted on other Gitub repositories.
All the models are CORS-enabled because they are hosted on GitHub.


In order to view the models, you need files viewers.
Here is one you can use:
[OBJ Viewer Basic]( http://jaanga.github.io/3d-models/viewers/obj-viewer-basic/obj-viewer-basic-r1.html )
The links to OBJ files below use this viewer. 
Further details on the OBJ file viewer available here: [Viewers]( http://aanga.github.io/3d-models/viewers )
